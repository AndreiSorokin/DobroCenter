# DobroCenter
<a href="dobrocenter.fi">Dobrocenter</a>

### I developed this website as a freelancer for a Finnish organization dedicated to promoting development and creative leisure activities for children and adults.

### The website was constructed using Vanilla JS, CSS, and PHP, in accordance with the customer's specifications.

#### While working on the Dobrocenter project, I used to be in touch with the customer, managing the project by myself. This included negotiating with my client, presenting Figma designs, making changes according to altered needs, and implementing the design on the webpage.
